## Development steps

In the root of the project run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

When all npm packages have been downloaded run `npm run start` to start the development server. Access the development server on `http://127.0.0.1:4444/src/`.

## Build steps

When you are done developing you are able to build the project and view it's output

Test what is built by running `npm run build:test`. This will provision a development server accessed `http://127.0.0.1:5555/public/`

If happy with the output run `npm run build` to build the production files that can be found in the `/public` directory in the root of the project.
